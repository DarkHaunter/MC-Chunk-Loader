Pre-prototype JavaScript world viewer for Minecraft Alpha files.  
This is not particularly useful at the moment except for people that 
may want a starting point for loading MineCraft files in JavaScript.
The world.js and nbt.js may be explanatory since it is fairly short
(but crappy, I know).

See files for credits of things I copy-pasted from the internet.

Put on a good web server (VPS) with world/ in same folder. 
Might work locally, I haven't tried that.
You will need to put this in the Apache conf (if that is what you are using):

AddEncoding x-gzip .dat

That will make it so the browser decompresses the level files.

Tested with chromium --enable-webgl . Chrome Beta doesn't perform WebGL well for me. 
Works in webgl enabled browsers http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Getting_a_WebGL_Implementation .

Please consider making this suck less and posting a link somewhere or forking
to a less crappy branch.

Thank you.
